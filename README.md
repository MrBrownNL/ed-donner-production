### How this repo is organized

- Each week of the course gets its own folder; start in the week1 folder and pick day1.md
- There are many essential guides in the [guides](guides/01_intro.ipynb) section
- Please `git pull` frequently to get the latest updates - see (Guide 3 in the Guides folder)[guides/03_git_and_github.ipynb] on how to pull.


### The deal you made

At the end of Day 1 in the course, I cunningly got you to agree to my terms!!

Repeat this to yourself through gritted teeth each time you're frustrated by an infrastructure roadblock..

1. I will embrace every roadblock with a positive attitude - this is where the learning happens!
2. I will be happy to roll up sleeves and dig in and do research and experiments myself and post on forums
3. I will use LLMs to help, but I recognize their blind-spots and will verify everything they suggest
4. I will post issues on Udemy, and Ed will try to help, but I understand that itâ€™s not like code and if Ed canâ€™t reproduce, then Iâ€™ll need to stick at it or move on
5. Iâ€™ll look for opportunities to help others in the community that are stuck

But do reach out and I'll try my very best..

### Making contributions

When you deploy projects, please make a new markdown file or python notebook in the community_contributions folder:
1. A short description of your project
2. A link to your repo
3. A link to you live, deployed project, if available
4. Anything about the experience that you'd like to share with other students

Then submit a PR so I can include it in the repo! See (Guide 3 in the Guides folder)[guides/03_git_and_github.ipynb] for more on submitting a PR.

### ABOVE ALL ELSE -

Be sure to have fun with the course! I have great stuff in store for you. There will definitely be some gnarly moments, but when you solve the issues, they will be very satisfying. And if not - [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddonner/).
