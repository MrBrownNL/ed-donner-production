# Community Contributions for Production Course

Hi everybody!

With my other courses, community_contributions have been a fabulous way to have students share their work with me and each other. People have submitted a PR with their code into community_contributions and I merge it in.

With this course, it's more tricky, because you'll each be working in entire repos. But I'd still like to gather your work!

Here's my suggestion:

1. Work in your own repo and github, and push your repo to your github
2. Then make a file here, in this directory. Either a Markdown file or a .ipynb
3. In this file, include a link to your Github repo, and a brief description of your project, and anything you'd like to share about the journey
4. Submit a PR - see [Guide 3](../guides/03_git_and_github.ipynb) for instructions
5. I will merge it in here. And please check out others!

I can't wait to see your projects and your progress as you grow your expertise in AI deployments to Production.
